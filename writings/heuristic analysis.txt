Since the visulization doesn't work and time is very very limited due to deadlines of term I, I justed tried 3 strategy and here are the results. You can better understand them if looking at the code. Don't worry, I add those analysis as comments on the customized_score() functions.

Strategy: all opponent's legal moves are equal
Results: 42.86%
    ----------
    Discussion:
    This scoring function just blindly evalue the number of possible legal moves left as if
    the player can make move immediately insteading of waiting for the opponent to finish.
    So it doesn't consider locations, nor the future board after opponenet's move.
    It's actually surpiringly win the MM_Improved by 11 to 9

Strategy: Copy-and-paste   
Results: 85.00%
    ----------
    Discussion:
    Borrowing from the improved score from lecture. This works I guess because it includes both legal moves for me and for opponents.

Strategy: Edges are more important
Results: 76.43%
    ----------            
    Discussion:
    This heuristic was an attempt to weight the number of moves left to the player with their
    respective position on the board. By multiplying by the absolute value of the difference
    between their x and y positions and the total width of the board, I am penalizing positions
    in the center of the board and rewarding positions closer to the edges.
